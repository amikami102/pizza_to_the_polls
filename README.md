This project locates long polling lines in the United States using Twitter data. The tweets come from Pizza to the Polls, a nonprofit organization that delivers pizzas to voters waiting in line, on 2018 Midterm Election day. I investigate which districts were in contact with Pizza to the Polls on 2018 Midterm Election Day and how the organization can improve its outreach for the 2020 election based on the data.
