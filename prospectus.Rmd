Pizza to the Polls is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that delivers pizzas during elections to polling locations. Voters send tweets to <tt>@PizzaToThePolls</tt>, and then Pizza To The Polls responds back. A typical response tweet says that pizzas have been requested to be delivered to a polling location and mentions the full address of the polling location. On their [homepage](https://polls.pizza/), Pizza to the Polls counts 10,793 pizzas sent to 611 polling locations across 41 states during the 2018 midterm election. 

In this project, I have scraped <tt>@PizzaToThePolls</tt>'s tweets and located polling stations where pizzas were delivered. The result is presented in the map below.
